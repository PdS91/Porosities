# Porosities

- Required packages are listed in the Requirements.txt
- Explenation and methodology are presented in the Notebooks --> Starting with DataAnalysis is suggested
- Need to replace the variable path = 'c:/Users/Pietro/Desktop/Porosities/Porosities/' with your local path to run the notebooks
- For deep learning framework I tested my code on collab but I didn't have other computational resources. Training has been run on a maximum of 100 epochs on cpu.
